My name is Chris Wickham. I'm an experienced data scientist and technical program manager at IBM, and, like any technologist, I often have to pick up new technologies quickly. For the past few years, my notes and code snippets from new technologies have sat around in various local directories, disorganized and, a few months later, hard to interpret, even for myself. After a recent interview client engagement where I was asked to revisit a technology I had used recently and found my old notes hard to use, I decided to change that. 

That repository serves a few purposes for me. First of all, it's a reference library. I use this repo to document technologies and frameworks that worked, so that I can go back and use them again! It's also my Curriculum Vitae, which I'll send to prospective clients to show them what I'm capable. And finally, I use it for my own training and exploration. When a client asks me about a new technology (e.g., "Should we be using AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? How would you plan an overhaul of our IT Architecture? Can you show me how Hadoop works?"), and I go out to conduct research and draw on past experiences, I document new things here as soon as I find them. 

In sum, this repository captures technologies, methodologies, and code excerpts that I've worked with and/or developed during my career. I hope you enjoy, and if you'd like to discuss, please reach out. 

There are two main (sometimes overlapping) categories I've put here: 

## Technologies
| Name        | Directory   
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Coding Languages|:-------------:|
| Python (Pandas, Numpy, etc.)| [link](Technologies/Python.md)  |


## Methodologies, Frameworks, and Management Tools
| Name        | Directory   
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Microsoft 365| [link](Methodologies_Frameworks_MgmtTools/Microsoft_365.md)  |
