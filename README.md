# Welcome!

My name is Chris Wickham. I'm an experienced data scientist and technical program manager at IBM, and, like any technologist, I often have to pick up new technologies quickly. For the past few years, my notes and code snippets from new technologies and technical maangement frameworks have sat around in various local directories, disorganized and, a few months later, hard to interpret, even for myself. After a recent interview client engagement where I was asked to revisit a technology I had used recently and found my old notes hard to use, I decided to change that. 

That repository serves a few purposes for me. First of all, it's a reference library. I use this repo to document technologies and frameworks that worked, so that I can go back and use them again! It's also my Curriculum Vitae, which I'll send to prospective clients to show them what I'm capable. And finally, I use it for my own training and exploration. When a client asks me about a new technology (e.g., "Should we be using AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? How would you plan an overhaul of our IT Architecture? Can you show me how Hadoop works?"), and I go out to conduct research and draw on past experiences, I will document new things here as soon as I have a chance.  

In sum, this repository captures technologies, methodologies, and code excerpts that I've worked with and/or developed during my career. I hope you enjoy, and if you'd like to discuss, please reach out. 

I just started this report in mid-June 2022, and it's still a work in progress. Ultimately, I want every entry in the technologies section to have code snippets for, at minimum, hello world, as well as a description of pros, cons, and use cases.
