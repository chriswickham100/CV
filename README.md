# Welcome!

My name is Chris Wickham. I'm an experienced data scientist and technical program manager at IBM, and, like any technologist, I often have to pick up new technologies quickly. For the a few years, my notes and code snippets from technologies and technical maangement frameworks sat around in various local directories. After a recent interview client engagement where I was asked to revisit a technology I had used recently and found my old notes hard to use, I decided to change that. 

This repository serves a few purposes for me. First of all, it's a reference library. I use this repo to document technologies and frameworks that worked, so that I can go back and use them again! None of these scripts or notes are proprietary or polished to the extent that I would use them at an actual client site; they're my own notes that I might leverage to lead an informal discussion on a prospective technology. It's also my Curriculum Vitae, which I'll send to prospective clients to show them what I'm capable. And finally, I use it for my own training and exploration. When a client asks me about a new technology (e.g., "Should we be using AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? How would you plan an overhaul of our IT Architecture? Can you show me how Hadoop works?"), and I go out to conduct research and draw on past experiences, I will document new things here as soon as I have a chance.  

In sum, this repository captures technologies, methodologies, and code excerpts that I've worked with and/or developed during my career. I hope you enjoy, and if you'd like to discuss, please reach out. 

I just started this report in mid-June 2022, and it's still a work in progress. Ultimately, I want every entry in the technologies section to have code snippets for, at minimum, hello world, as well as a description of pros, cons, and use cases.
