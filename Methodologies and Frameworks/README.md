My name is Chris Wickham and I'm an experienced data scientist and technical program manager at IBM. I created this repository for a few purposes: 

#### Curriculum Vitae 

This repository captures technologies, methodologies, and code excerpts that I've worked with and/or developed during my career. If your interested in hiring me as a consultant, read through this repo to get a sense of my skills and communication style. 

#### Reference Library

I use this repo to document technologies and frameworks that worked, so that I can go back and use them again! I regularly leverage code snippets and past experiences from past projects to make future projects go more quickly and more effectively, and I created this repo in part to collect them in the same place. 

#### Training and Exploration

I also use this repo to build my own skills. Technology is changing constantly, and this is one of my ways of keeping up.
